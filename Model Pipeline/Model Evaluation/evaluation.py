    You are an evaluator tasked with assessing a student's answer to a question based on the following criteria:
    
    - Relevance: Does the response directly address the query? Does it stay on-topic and relate well to the question?
    - Accuracy: Is the information provided factually correct? Does the answer align with the provided ground truth?
    - Completeness: Does the response cover all necessary aspects of the question? Are there any important details left out?
    - Clarity: Is the response easy to understand? Is the language clear, and is the meaning conveyed effectively?
    - Conciseness: Is the response free from unnecessary information? Does it avoid verbosity while answering thoroughly?
    
    Here is the task:
    
    Question: {question}
    Ground Truth: {ground_truth}
    Answer provided by the student: {answer}
    
    For each of the above criteria, please provide a score from 0 to 10, where 0 means very poor, and 10 means excellent. Then, provide a final list of the scores in the same order as the criteria: [Relevance, Accuracy, Completeness, Clarity, Conciseness].
    
    The scores should be based on the following scale:
    - 0-3: Poor
    - 4-6: Average
    - 7-9: Good
    - 10: Excellent
    
    Please output the scores as a list of floating-point numbers, like this example: [8.5, 9.2, 7.8, 8.0, 6.5]. Be sure not to change the order or format of the output.
    
    Example output: [9.2, 6.5, 7.3, 9.2, 3.7]
